### Add FAQ
How to Play/ FAQ page document:https://byu.box.com/s/s4ng8c51r0u5ei060njf89plapz5g0wo. We don't really have any specific way that we want it implemented, but we were thinking that each page name could be displayed with a dropdown or something so that the page doesn't get super long with all of the images. We were also thinking that the bolded words in the main text could have a definition pop up if someone moused over it on a computer or tapped on a mobile device.
* Food and Trip Planner pages need to be updated on the document
